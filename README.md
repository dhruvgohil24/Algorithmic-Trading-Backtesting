# Trading Strategy and Backtesting â€“ HDFC Bank & NSE Stocks

This project focuses on **algorithmic trading strategy development and backtesting**, using real stock data from NSE, including **HDFC Bank** and other major stocks like Infosys, Tata Motors, Wipro, and Asian Paints. 

The goal is to test and evaluate trading strategies with proper performance metrics and visualizations to understand their effectiveness in real market scenarios.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates the **complete trading strategy workflow**:
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Download historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data using `yfinance`.
2. **Strategy Development** â€“ Generate buy/sell signals based on rules and conditions.
3. **Backtesting Engine** â€“ Simulate trades over historical data.
4. **Performance Analysis** â€“ Calculate essential metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and drawdowns.
5. **Visualization** â€“ Plot equity curves, drawdowns, and portfolio growth using interactive Plotly charts.

This helps in identifying whether a strategy is profitable and robust before deploying it in a live trading environment.
